                    Verification procedures

                    Identity verification
                    pampBit Financial Company OÜ’s identity verification procedure requires the User to provide pampBit Financial Company OÜ with reliable, independent source documents, data or information (e.g., national ID, international passport, bank statement, utility bill). For such purposes pampBit Financial Company OÜ reserves the right to collect User’s identification information for the AML/KYC Policy purposes.
                    pampBit Financial Company OÜ will take steps to confirm the authenticity of documents and information provided by the Users.

In addition, pampBit Financial Company OÜ reserves the right to request up-to-date documents from the Users, even though they have passed identity verification in the past.
                    User’s identification information will be collected, stored, shared and protected strictly in accordance with the pampBit Financial Company OÜ’s Privacy Policy and related regulations. Once the User’s identity has been verified, pampBit Financial Company OÜ is able to remove itself from potential legal liability in a situation where its Services are used to conduct illegal activity.</h2>

                <h2>
                    Monitoring Transactions
                    The Users are known not only by verifying their identity (who they are) but, more importantly, by analyzing their transactional patterns (what they do). Therefore, pampBit Financial Company OÜ relies on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. pampBit Financial Company OÜ performs a variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data, filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and reporting. System functionalities include:
                    1) Daily check of Users against recognized “black lists” (e.g. OFAC), aggregating transfers by multiple data points, placing Users on watch and service denial lists, opening cases for investigation where needed, sending internal communications and filling out statutory reports, if applicable;
                    2) Case and document management.
                    With regard to the AML/KYC Policy, pampBit Financial Company OÜ will monitor all transactions and it reserves the right to: ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement through the Compliance Officer;
                    request the User to provide any additional information and documents in case of suspicious transactions;
                    suspend or terminate User’s Account when pampBit Financial Company OÜ has reasonably suspicion that such User engaged in illegal activity.
                    The above list is not exhaustive and the Compliance Officer will monitor Users’ transactions on a day-to-day basis in order to define whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious or are to be treated as bona fide.</h2>
                <h2>Risk Assessment
                    pampBit Financial Company OÜ, in line with the international requirements, has adopted a risk-based approach to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. By adopting a risk-based approach, pampBit Financial Company OÜ is able to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are commensurate to the identified risks. This will allow resources to be allocated in the most efficient ways. The principle is that resources should be directed in accordance with priorities so that the greatest risks receive the highest attention.</h2>
